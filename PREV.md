GitHub Actions makes it easier than ever to incorporate continuous integration (CI) into your repositories. 

This course will get you from zero-to-CI by setting up two workflow files to automate the way you work.


## What you'll learn

We'll answer common questions like:

- What is Continuous Integration?
- How do GitHub Actions and workflows enable CI?
- What are build artifacts and how are they used?
- How can a unit testing framework be implemented with GitHub Actions?

And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Describe the importance of GitHub Actions in Continuous Integration
- Use and customize a templated workflow
- Create CI workflows that match a team's needs and behaviors
- Use a repository's source code and build artifacts across jobs in a workflow
- Implement a unit testing framework using GitHub Actions
- Create a workflow that runs tests and produces test reports
- Set up a matrix build to create build artifacts for multiple target platforms
- Save and access a repository's build artifacts
- Choose virtual environments for an application's CI needs

## What you'll build
In this course, we'll be walking through CI using GitHub Actions, and creating a Tic Tac Toe game!

## Prerequisites
Before you start, you should be familiar with GitHub. We recommend taking the following two Learning Labs prior to this course:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
- [Hello GitHub Actions!](https://lab.github.com/github/hello-github-actions!)

And a great follow-on course is 
- [Continuous Delivery with GitHub Actions](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-continuous-delivery/)

## Projects used
This course makes use of the following technologies:

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a popular JavaScript testing framework.

## Audience

Developers, DevOps Engineers, new GitHub users, students, teams

# Welcome

In this repository, we'll be diving into the world of Continuous Integration. **Continuous Integration**, or **CI**, can benefit your projects and change how you work on GitHub. If you're new to Continuous Integration, you may be thinking, "What exactly is it, and do I need it in my project?"

### What is CI? Why should you care?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="a gear and a loop, representing continuous integration" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88584678-3e81c400-d00f-11ea-95e0-01d8708c6e84.png">
</p>

[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your team’s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits. The results post back to GitHub in the pull request. This reduces context switching for developers, and improves consistency for testing. The goal is fewer bugs in production and faster feedback while developing.

Choices around CI that will work best for your project depend on many factors, including:

- Programming language and application architecture
- Operating system and browsers you plan to support
- Your team’s experience and skills
- Scaling capabilities and plans for growth
- Geographic distribution of dependent systems and the people who use them
- Packaging and delivery goals

### Using CI and Learning Lab

In other courses, you may have noticed that some actions take me longer to respond to than others. In this course, many of the actions will be related to builds. Those builds sometimes take longer to build, up to several minutes. Don't be concerned if I take a few minutes to respond, or if I respond too quickly. Sometimes, I'll let you know what the build will say before it finishes! Please wait for the builds to finish before moving on to your next step.

If you aren't already familiar, it may be a good idea to go through the [Introduction to GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

## Step 1: Use a templated workflow

<img alt="icon of a bug in a browser window" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88585528-6f162d80-d010-11ea-8efa-1e6d6d8bcb99.png">

There's a bug somewhere in this repository. We'll use the practice of Continuous Integration (CI) to set up some automated testing to make it easier to discover, diagnose, and minimize scenarios like this.

Let's first introduce CI to this repository. The codebase is written with Node.js. GitHub Actions allows us to use some templated workflows for common languages and frameworks, like Node.js! Let's add it:

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request with a templated workflow

1. Go to the [Actions tab]({{ actionsUrl }}).
2. Choose the template Node.js workflow.
3. Commit the workflow to a new branch.
4. Create a pull request titled **CI for Node**.

I'll respond in the new pull request when I detect it has been created.

---

If at any point you're expecting a response and don't see one, refresh the page.


The title of this pull request isn't what I expected!

To rename your pull request:
1. Click on **Edit** next to the pull request's title. 
1. The title will turn to a text field, **{{ title }}** in the title field.
1. Click **Save**.

I'll respond when I detect this pull request has been renamed.

## Templated workflow success!

Great job adding the templated workflow. Adding that file to this branch is enough for GitHub Actions to begin running CI on your repository. This takes a couple of minutes, so let's take this opportunity to learn about some of the components of the workflow file you just added. We'll dive deeper into some of the key elements of this file in future steps of the course.

## Step 2: Run a templated workflow

I'll respond when GitHub Actions finishes running the workflow. You can follow along in the [Actions tab]({{ actionsUrl }}), or by clicking **Details** on the pending status below.

---

<details><summary>Actions workflow not running? Click here</summary>

When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below.

![checks in progress in a merge box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/66080348-ecc5f580-e533-11e9-909e-c213b08790eb.png)

If the checks don't appear or if the checks are stuck in progress, there's a few things you can do to try and trigger them:

- Refresh the page, it's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with that change
- Try making a commit on this branch. Our workflow is triggered with a `push` event, and committing to this branch will result in a new `push`
- Edit the workflow file on GitHub and ensure there are no red lines indicating a syntax problem
</details>

## 'on:'

The `on:` field is what tells GitHub Actions when to run. In this case, we're running the workflow anytime there's a `push`.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions: `on:`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) on GitHub Help 
- [Events that trigger workflows](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) on GitHub Help

## Jobs

The `jobs:` block defines the core component of an Actions workflow. Workflows are made of jobs, and our template workflow defines a single job with the identifier `build`.

Every job also needs a specific host machine on which to run, the `runs-on:` field is how we specify it. The template workflow is running the `build` job in the latest version of Ubuntu, a Linux-based operating system.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:

## Vocabulary

#### Workflows, steps, actions, and jobs

![An illustration split in two. On the left: illustration of how GitHub Actions terms are encapsulated. At the highest level: workflows and event triggers. Inside of workflows: jobs and definition of the build environment. Inside jobs: steps. Inside steps: a call to an action. On the right: the sequence: workflows, job, step, action.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png)

Let's dig into the vocabulary of GitHub Actions.

- **Workflow**: A workflow is a unit of automation from start to finish, including the definition of what triggers the automation, what environment or other aspects should be taken account during the automation, and what should happen as a result of the trigger.
- **Job**: A job is a section of the workflow, and is made up of one or more steps. In this section of our workflow, the template defines the steps that make up the `build` job.
- **Step**: A step represents one _effect_ of the automation. A step could be defined as a GitHub Action, or another unit, like printing something to the console.
- **Action**: A GitHub Action is a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or you can write them yourself!

#### What is `checkout`?

The power of **GitHub** Actions lies in access to actions written by the :sparkles: GitHub community. Here, we'll use two Actions officially written and supported by GitHub:
- `actions/checkout@v2` is used to ensure our virtual machine has a copy of our codebase. The checked out code will be used to run tests against.
- `actions/setup-node@v1` is used to set up proper versions of Node.js since we'll be performing testing against multiple versions.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions: `jobs.<job_id>.steps:`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps) on GitHub Help 
- [Referencing actions in your workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#referencing-actions-in-your-workflow) on GitHub Help
- Source repository for the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action
- Source repository for the [`actions/setup-node`](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) action


## 'run:'

In addition to running pre-built actions, the workflow can also execute commands, just as you would if you had direct access to the virtual machine. In this portion of the template workflow, we run some common commands relevant to Node.js projects, like `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm test` to run the chosen testing framework.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions: `jobs.<job_id>.steps.run:`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun) on GitHub Help 
- [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) on the npm Documentation
- [`npm run`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) on the npm Documentation
- [`npm test`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/test.html) on the npm Documentation

If you don't see an explanation of your CI logs below when the workflow has executed, refresh this page.

## What is this pull request doing? 

This pull request introduces [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a popular JavaScript testing framework. We'll use it to learn how to use it for continuous integration.

When the bot asks you to, merge this pull request.

Great job! Go ahead and merge this pull request so your changes are automatically shared with anyone that contributes to this project.

I'll respond when you merge this pull request.


# Running - and failing - workflow

The workflow ran! But it failed :sob:. But, that's OK. Every time CI fails, it's an opportunity to learn from what's causing it. By running CI with GitHub Actions, we have access to the logs for the attempted build. These are found:
- In the [Actions]({{ actionsUrl }}) tab
- In the merge box for this pull request, by clicking on "Details".

If you navigate over to the build logs, you may notice that the error is "No tests found".

![screenshot of build log showing a missing `__test__` directory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/65921324-eeff4700-e3af-11e9-8625-3aacfe64d06b.png)

Learning how to read build logs and isolate the cause of the problem is an art on its own. We'll try and cover some of the basics here. In our case, the source of the error is the `npm test` command. The `npm test` command looks for a testing framework. We want to use Jest, as we mentioned earlier. Jest requires unit tests in a [directory named `__test__`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#testmatch-array-string). A `__test__` directory doesn't exist on this branch.

## Step 3: Add your first test

Not to worry, I've got you covered! Navigate to the open pull request titled [Add Jest tests]({{ url }}) and merge it into this branch. That'll get us the test files we need. I'll respond when you merge the [Add Jest tests pull request]({{ url }}) into this branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add your first test script for CI to pick up

1.  Navigate to the open pull request titled [Add Jest tests]({{ url }})
2.  Merge the pull request

# Waiting on tests

Great! Now that the testing framework is properly configured, we should get a response from it soon. This time, you'll practice reading the logs on your own. Just like before, you can follow along as GitHub Actions runs your job by going to the [Actions tab]({{ actionsUrl }}) or by clicking on "Details" in the merge box below.

When the tests finish, you'll see a red X :x: or a green check mark :heavy_check_mark: in the merge box. At that point, you'll have access to logs for the build job and its associated steps.

## Step 4: Read an Actions log

**By looking at the logs, can you identify which tests failed?** To find it, go to one of the failed builds and scrolling through the log. Look for a section that lists all the unit tests. We're looking for the name of the test with an "x".

![screenshot of a sample build log with the names of the tests blurred out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/65922013-e740a200-e3b1-11e9-8151-faf52c30201e.png)

### :keyboard: Activity: Tell the bot which test is failing so we can fix it

1. Navigate to the log output
2. Identify a name of a failing test
3. Comment the name of the failing test here

I'll respond when you enter the name of at least one failing test. You can either copy and paste that portion of the log directly, or type the name of the test as a comment.

Let's go to the [next step]({{ url }}).


That wasn't the test name I expected, but that's alright. If you typed something slightly different than what I looked for that may explain it. 

I expected one of the following test names:
- Contains the compiled JavaScript
- Initializes with two players
- Starts the game with a random player
- Sets the current player to be whoever it is not

Let's keep going anyway!

# Reading failed logs

One of the failing tests is: `Initializes with two players`. If you dig deeper into the logs, you may notice these results in particular:

```shell
  ● Game › Game › Initializes with two players

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: "Nate"
    Received: "Bananas"

      12 |     it('Initializes with two players', async () => {
      13 |       expect(game.p1).toBe('Salem')
    > 14 |       expect(game.p2).toBe('Nate')
         |                       ^
      15 |     })
      16 | 
      17 |     it('Initializes with an empty board', async () => {

      at Object.toBe (__test__/game.test.js:14:23)
```

This tells us that a unit test has been written that names the two players Salem and Nate, and then checks if that name sticks. However, we get :banana: Bananas instead of Nate! How did this happen?

To find out, it may help to know it's common practice to name test files the same as the code file they are testing, but with a `.test.js` extension. Therefore, we can assume that the test result from `game.test.js` is caused by a problem in `game.js`. I'll point it out below.

Make the changes suggested below. I'll respond when the workflow runs.

<details><summary>Actions workflow not running? Click here</summary>

When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below. 

![checks in progress in a merge box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/66080348-ecc5f580-e533-11e9-909e-c213b08790eb.png)

If the checks don't appear or if the checks are stuck in progress, there's a few things you can do to try and trigger them:

- Refresh the page, it's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with that change
- Try making a commit on this branch. Our workflow is triggered with a `push` event, and committing to this branch will result in a new `push`
- Edit the workflow file on GitHub and ensure there are no red lines indicating a syntax problem
</details>

## Step 5: Fix the test

This line is causing the problem. Let's fix it by initializing this instance of `p2` to the proper value. 

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the file that's causing the test to fail

Edit the `src/game.js` file directly, or accept the suggestion below.

```suggestion
    this.p2 = p2
```

Once you commit the changes, the tests will run again and should pass. I'll respond when the tests pass. If the tests don't pass, I'll provide some troubleshooting information.

The Actions workflow failed and I was expecting it to succeed. Let's see if we can find how to fix it.

Try the following:
{{ troubleshooting }}

I'll respond when you commit and the tests run again.

Great job! Go ahead and merge this pull request so your changes are automatically shared with anyone that contributes to this project.

I'll respond when you merge this pull request.


# Custom workflow

Now that we've learned how to quickly set up CI, let's try a more realistic use case.

Our fictional team has a custom workflow that goes beyond the template we've used so far. We would like the following features:

<img alt="an icon of three gears" align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88609410-48241f80-d041-11ea-85ad-b77a5d08bfd1.png"><br/>
**Test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working

<img alt="icon of gears indicating relationship between multiple jobs" align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88609439-55410e80-d041-11ea-8186-09b2008e2572.png"><br/>
**Dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details

<img alt="icon of a binary file" align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88609455-5ffba380-d041-11ea-9e29-c2bac7a8dfd4.png"><br/>
**Access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment

<img alt="icon of a security shield indicating branch protections" align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88609465-6a1da200-d041-11ea-9c4c-55ffe90a3e72.png"><br/>
**Branch protections** so that the `main` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken

<img alt="icon of a review approval" align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88609558-9df8c780-d041-11ea-906f-dd23efd9f65c.png"><br/>
**Required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates

<img alt="icon of a review approval" align="left" width="50" height="50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88609481-73a70a00-d041-11ea-959d-27b33c2d4028.png"><br/>
**Obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments

## Step 7: Create a custom GitHub Actions workflow

Can GitHub Actions support this workflow? Let's find out. We'll tackle some of the changes to the existing workflow file first.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the existing workflow with new build targets

1. Edit your [existing workflow]({{ workflowUrl }}) file in a new branch
2. In that file, target versions `12.x` and `14.x` of Node, only
3. Open a new pull request titled **Improve CI** for your change.

I'll respond when you open the pull request.


Let's go to the [next step]({{ url }}).


The title of this pull request isn't what I expected!

To rename your pull request:
1. Click on **Edit** next to the pull request's title. 
1. The title will turn to a text field, **{{ title }}** in the title field.
1. Click **Save**.

I'll respond when I detect this pull request has been renamed.

# Matrix builds

Great work so far! By targeting specific versions of Node, we've configured a **build matrix** which allow us to test across multiple operating systems, platforms, and language versions. See [Configuring a matrix build](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#configuring-a-build-matrix) in GitHub Help if you'd like to learn more.

I'll respond when you commit the changes in the comment below.


## Step 8: Target a Windows environment

Since we'd like to support deploying our app to Windows environments, let's add Windows to the matrix build configuration.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit your workflow file to build for Windows environments

<img alt="an icon of three gears" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88591917-5ca0f180-d01a-11ea-8ed2-219aa3392cf2.png">

You can follow the suggestion, or manually make the changes in the numbered instructions.

```suggestion
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-2016]
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x]
```

1. Edit the workflow config at [`.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`]({{ fileUrl }})
2. Add an `os` field to the `strategy.matrix` section of your workflow
3. Add `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-2016` to the target operating systems
4. Commit your workflow changes to this branch.

I'll respond in this pull request when you've committed.


# New Job

Great, if you look at the logs now, you'll notice that multiple builds will exist: 4 build to be exact! That's because for each of the 2 operating systems we're running tests against 2 versions so: 2 OS :heavy_multiplication_x: 2 Node.js versions = 4 builds.

Our custom workflow now accounts for:
- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working

## Step 9: Use multiple jobs

<img alt="icon of gears indicating relationship between multiple jobs" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88592093-aab5f500-d01a-11ea-8631-b2200684e7e0.png">

Let's now try to create a dedicated test job and satisfy the second item in our custom workflow checklist. 

This will allow us to separate the build and test functions of our workflow into more than one job that will run when our workflow is triggered.

### Activity: Edit your workflow file to separate build and test jobs

1. Edit [your workflow file]({{ fileUrl }})
2. Create a new job called "test" as follows (we'll use ellipses `...` to only show the parts of the workflow we're interested in, but you should not copy the ellipses directly):
    ```yaml
    name: Node CI

    on: [push]

    jobs:
      build:
        ...
      test:
        ...
    ```  
3. In the `build` job, include the following portions of your existing workflow:
    ```yaml
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: npm install and build webpack
          run: |
            npm install
            npm run build
    ```
4. In the newly created `test` job, include the following portions of your existing workflow:
    ```yaml
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-2016]
          node-version: [12.x, 14.x]
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
      - name: npm install, and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
        env:
          CI: true
    ```

<details><summary>If you'd like to copy and paste the full workflow file instead, click here to see it in its entirety.</summary>

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: npm install and build webpack
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

  test:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-2016]
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
    - name: npm install, and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm test
      env:
        CI: true
```
</details>

When you commit to this branch, the workflow should run again. I'll respond when it is finished running.

---

<details><summary>Actions workflow not running? Click here</summary>

When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below.

![checks in progress in a merge box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/66080348-ecc5f580-e533-11e9-909e-c213b08790eb.png)

If the checks don't appear or if the checks are stuck in progress, there's a few things you can do to try and trigger them:

- Refresh the page, it's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with that change
- Try making a commit on this branch. Our workflow is triggered with a `push` event, and committing to this branch will result in a new `push`
- Edit the workflow file on GitHub and ensure there are no red lines indicating a syntax problem

# Waiting on tests

Great! We've now got two nicely separated `build` and `test` jobs. Our custom workflow now accounts for:
- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working
- :white_check_mark: **dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details

If you'd like to learn more about jobs, see:
- [About GitHub Actions: Job](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions#job) in GitHub Help
- [About CI: Job](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-continuous-integration#job) in GitHub Help
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions: `jobs`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobs)

## Step 10: Run multiple jobs

### :keyboard: Activity: Wait for the result of multiple jobs in your workflow

No action required in this step - just waiting. I'll respond when the workflow runs your jobs.

<details><summary>Actions workflow not running? Click here</summary>

When a GitHub Actions workflow is running, you should see some checks in progress, like the screenshot below. 

![checks in progress in a merge box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/66080348-ecc5f580-e533-11e9-909e-c213b08790eb.png)

If the checks don't appear or if the checks are stuck in progress, there's a few things you can do to try and trigger them:

- Refresh the page, it's possible the workflow ran and the page just hasn't been updated with that change
- Try making a commit on this branch. Our workflow is triggered with a `push` event, and committing to this branch will result in a new `push`
- Edit the workflow file on GitHub and ensure there are no red lines indicating a syntax problem
</details>

# Use the upload

The workflow has finished running!

You may notice `build` succeeded, but each of the `test` jobs failed. That's because the build artifacts created in `build` aren't available to the `test` job. Each job executes in a fresh instance of the virtual environment. This is due to the [design of the virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#about-virtual-environments) themselves.

So what do we do when we need the work product of one job in another? We can use the built-in [artifact storage](https://help.github.com/en/articles/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts) to save artifacts created from one job to be used in another job within the same workflow. 

## Step 11: Upload a job's build artifacts

<img alt="icon of a binary file" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88592731-b2c26480-d01b-11ea-850e-c87588aadf4f.png">

Artifacts allow you to persist data after a job has completed, and share that data with another job in the same workflow. An artifact is a file or collection of files produced during a workflow run.

To upload artifacts to the artifact storage, we can use an action built by GitHub: [`actions/upload-artifacts`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact).

### :keyboard: Activity: Use the upload action in your workflow file to save a job's build artifacts

_You can follow the manual steps below, or accept the suggestion in the following comment._

1. Edit [your workflow file]({{ fileUrl }})
1. Add a step to your `build` job that uses the `upload-artifacts` action.
    ```yaml
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: npm install and build webpack
            run: |
              npm install
              npm run build
          - uses: actions/upload-artifact@main
            with:
              name: webpack artifacts
              path: public/
    ```
1. Commit your change to this branch

I'll respond when you commit to this branch.


You can commit this suggestion directly.

```suggestion
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
          name: webpack artifacts
          path: public/
```


# Use the download

Great! The build artifacts will now be uploaded to the artifact storage. If you wait for the workflow to finish, you'll notice the `test` job still fails. This is for a number of reasons:
- jobs run in parallel, unless configured otherwise 
- each job runs in its own virtual environment, so although we've pushed our artifacts to storage, the `test` job needs to retrieve them.

## Step 12: Download a job's build artifacts

<img alt="icon of a binary file" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88592731-b2c26480-d01b-11ea-850e-c87588aadf4f.png">

To remedy this, we'll run `test` only after `build` is finished so the artifacts are available. 

Similar to the upload action to send artifacts to the storage, we'll use another action built by GitHub to download these previously uploaded artifacts from the `build` job: [`actions/download-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact).

### :keyboard: Activity: Use the download action in your workflow file to access a prior job's build artifacts

_You can follow the manual steps below, or accept the suggestions in the following comments._

1. Edit your [workflow file]({{ fileUrl }})
1. Configure the `test` job to run only after the `build` job is completed (we'll use ellipses `...` to only show the parts of the workflow we're interested in, but you should not copy the ellipses directly):
    ```yaml
      test:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        ...
    ```
1. Add a step to your `test` job that uses the `download-artifacts` action.
    ```yaml
      test:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        ...
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions/download-artifact@main
          with: 
            name: webpack artifacts
            path: public
        - name: Use Node.js {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.node-version }}{% endraw %}
        - name: npm install, and test
          run: |
            npm install
            npm test
          env:
            CI: true
    ```
    
I'll respond when you've edited your workflow file.

# Merge the CI

Awesome work! 

Our custom workflow now accounts for:
- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working
- :white_check_mark: **dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details
- :white_check_mark: **access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment

## Step 13: Share the improved CI workflow with the team

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge the pull request with the improved workflow

1. Merge this pull request so our new CI workflow is available to the entire team

----

In the next few steps, we'll finish supporting our team's workflow:
- **branch protections** so that the `main` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken
- **required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates
- **obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments

I'll respond when you merge this pull request.


# Partial workflow

Remember the [custom workflow]({{ workflowIssue }}) we are attempting to create for the team? Here's our status on the list of requirements we defined:

- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working
- :white_check_mark: **dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details
- :white_check_mark: **access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment
- **branch protections** so that the `main` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken
- **required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates
- **obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments

The last three remaining items don't really belong in a `code, build, and test` pipeline because they have to do with processes that involve humans.

## Step 14: Automate the review process

GitHub Actions can run multiple workflows for different event triggers. Let's create a new approval workflow that'll work together with our Node.js workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a new workflow file to automate the team's review process

1. Create a [new file]({{ fileUrl }}), `.github/workflows/approval-workflow.yml`, on this branch
1. Enter a name for your workflow in the new file, something like:
    ```yaml
    name: Team awesome's approval workflow
    ```

I'll respond when you commit to this branch.


Let's go to the [next step]({{ url }}).


# Choose the event

Great job creating a new workflow!

As we briefly discussed earlier, workflows can be configured to run:

- Using events from GitHub
- At a scheduled time
- When an event outside of GitHub occurs

Full details are available in [Events that trigger workflows](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) on GitHub Help. So far, we've used the [`push` event](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#push) for our Node.js workflow. That makes sense when we want to take action on code changes to our repository.

For a review workflow, we want to engage with human reviews, instead. For example, we'll use the [Label approved pull requests action](https://github.com/pullreminders/label-when-approved-action) so that we can easily see when we've gotten enough reviews to merge a pull request.

Let's prep our review workflow by triggering it with a [`pull_request_review` event](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_review).


## Step 15: Use an action to automate pull request reviews

Trigger your review workflow. Apply the suggestion or follow the instructions to do it directly.

### :keyboard: Activity: Use the community action in your new workflow

```suggestion
name: Team awesome's approval workflow
on: pull_request_review
```

1. Edit your newly created [workflow file]({{ editUrl }})
1. Below the title, run the workflow on a pull request review event:
    ```yaml
    on: pull_request_review
    ```
1. Commit your changes to this branch

I'll respond when you commit something to this branch.

# Add a job

Great work! Let's get some more practice with jobs. Apply the suggested change below or follow the instructions.

In a later step, we'll use an action that adds a label to any pull requests after a preset number of approvals. These labels could be used as a visual indicator to your team that something is ready to merge, or even as a way to use other actions or tools to automatically merge pull requests when they receive the required number of approvals.


## Step 16: Create an approval job in your new workflow

### :keyboard: Activity: In your new workflow file, create a new job that'll use the community action

1. Edit your newly created [workflow file]({{ editUrl }})
1. Create a new job called `labelWhenApproved`.
    ```suggestion
    on: pull_request_review
    jobs:
      labelWhenApproved:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ```
1. Commit your changes to this branch

I'll respond when you commit something to this branch.


# Add a step

We've now got a job with the `labelWhenApproved` identifier. We're off to a great start!

It's now time to use a community-created action. The action we'll use is [pullreminders/label-when-approved-action](https://github.com/pullreminders/label-when-approved-action). 


## Step 17: Automate approvals

<img alt="icon of a review approval" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88593701-2fa20e00-d01d-11ea-85df-d620868a5f0d.png">

Let's see if you can use this action on your own. 

**If you'd like a hint, submit a comment on this pull request with the word "hint".**
<br/><br/>

### Here's some tips to get you going:
- the workflow file needs a `steps:` block
- give your new step any name you wish
- to use a community action, use the `uses:` keyword
- `label-when-approved-action` requires a block called `env:` with the following environment variables:
  - `APPROVALS` is the number of required approvals that are required for a label to be applied, please set this to `"1"`
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` is necessary so the action can create and apply labels to this repository. See the action's documentation for how to use it
  - `ADD_LABEL` is the name of the label which should be added when the number of approvals have been met, choose any label name you wish

### :keyboard: Activity: Use the community action to automate part of the review approval process

1. Using your prior knowledge, configure the [pullreminders/label-when-approved-action](https://github.com/pullreminders/label-when-approved-action) action in this workflow

I'll respond when you push a new commit to this branch.


### Step 17: Hint

1. Edit the [workflow file]({{ editUrl }}) on this branch.
1. Give your step a name, have it use `pullreminders/label-when-approved-action@main`, and set all the required environment variables.
    ```suggestion
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Label when approved
          uses: pullreminders/label-when-approved-action@master
          env:
            APPROVALS: "1"
            GITHUB_TOKEN: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
            ADD_LABEL: "approved"
    ```
1. Commit your changes to this branch. 


# Our workflow

Awesome! We can now check an additional requirement off our list!

- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working
- :white_check_mark: **dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details
- :white_check_mark: **access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment
- :white_check_mark: **obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments
- **branch protections** so that the `main` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken
- **required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates

We'll now use branch protections in combination with this change so that everything goes smoothly. Up until now, I've handled branch protections for you, but I've removed them so that you can learn how to set them. 

Take a look at the merge box, you'll notice you can merge this even though the review process hasn't been met. Still see the protection? Refresh this page.

## Step 18: Use branch protections

<img alt="icon of a security shield indicating branch protections" align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88594106-ddadb800-d01d-11ea-9ec9-fca55c0c69e2.png">

Protected branches ensure that collaborators on your repository cannot make irrevocable changes to branches. Enabling protected branches also allows you to enable other optional checks and requirements, like required status checks and required reviews.

Next, add branch protections and continue with the course.

### :keyboard: Activity: Complete the automated review process by protecting the main branch

1. Go to [**Branches**]({{ settingsUrl}}/branches) settings. You can navigate to that page manually by clicking on the right-most tab in the top of the repository called **Settings** and then clicking on **Branches**.
2. Click on [**Add rule**]({{ settingsUrl }}/branch_protection_rules/new) under "Branch protection rules".
3. Type `main` in **Branch name pattern**.
4. Check **Require pull request reviews before merging**.
5. Check **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
6. Check all build and test jobs that you'd like to see in the newly visible gray box.  
7. Click **Create**.
8. Return to this pull request, and [approve the requested review]({{ approvalUrl }}).

I'll respond when I receive an approval from your pull request review. 


I couldn't detect your protected branch. Please protect your master branch, and approve this pull request once again.

# Congratulations!
